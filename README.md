## Description

This simple project was created to practice React and the UI framework Material UI. The app is a counter with 3 buttons: **+**, **-**, and **RESET**. Each button calls a function that changes the state of the number.

The project provides examples of how to use common components from Material UI with props. The Counter component is written as a functional component so the app provides an example of how to use the useState React hook. There is also a simple example of how to handle clicks for buttons.

#### Technologies

- React **v17.0.2**
- Material-UI **v4.11.4**

#### App Usage
The app itself is simple enough to use. You can click the **+** to add to the counter and **-** to subtract from the counter. Clicking the reset button will **reset** the counter back to 0.
